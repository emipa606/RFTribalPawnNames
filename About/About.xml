Update Rainbeau Flambes mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539314168

Regarding the view from RF about the vanilla tribal names can be questioned like this (from user Ric):
&quot;The tribal names in the base game RimWorld are from Galicians (Spanish Gaul tribes) during the Roman times. Tynan has confirmed this when he was asked about the names ... The impression that the in-game names are nonsense ... they are most certainly not.&quot;

[b]This mod overhauls tribal pawn naming. Why? Well, the tribal names in the game have always felt a bit... &quot;off&quot; to me. It&apos;s probably nothing more than my own unfamiliarity with the cultures from which the names are drawn, but I always thought they seemed a bit more &quot;Spanish&quot; than tribal.

The changes made by the mod are as follows:
	
[i]- Tribal pawn names are now Native American in style. (I drew the names from online &quot;Native American baby names&quot; lists, by the way, which I&apos;m well aware mix and match names from many different nations, and also feature many inauthentic names. But while they have many flaws, they provided the sort of names I was looking for. No disrespect to actual Native Americans is intended.)

- Tribal pawn nicknames can now include various adjectives, terrain features, weapons and the like. So you might run into a tribal pawn named Vengeful Weasel, for example, or Deadly Scythe.

- Since tribal names don&apos;t follow a &quot;personal name followed by family name&quot; pattern, anyway, the game no longer forces tribal pawns to share last names if they&apos;re related.

- Tribal factions and settlements will now have names consistent with the style of the individual pawns&apos; names.

- Pets in tribal factions will also now be given tribal-style names rather than colonist-style names.[/i]
